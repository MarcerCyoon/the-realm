    <div class="jewel">This game is timeless, man. The joy I felt playing it as an elementary schooler way past my bedtime hasn'<td></td>
      subsided at all. In some sense, my appreciation of this game only grows as time passes. In what should be a simply party game,
      Nintendo hid one of the most complex, beautiful, free-form fighting games of all time that continues to produce highlight moments
      almost 20 years after its release. It's the perfect balance of fun and competition, simplicity and complexity, defense and offense.</div>
