    <div class="jewel"> <b> Software Developer Fails at Making Simple Website </b> </div>
    <div class="jewel">When I decided to sit down and finally begin making a small website where I can host my idle thoughts,
      my immediate reaction was honestly probably fear. That's part of the reason I'm doing this, true, but still,
      man am I bad at web dev. Look, I literally learned just today you can
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors">make CSS classes within the CSS file</a>
      by doing .class_name. I... didn't know that was a thing.</div>
    <div class="jewel">I'm so amazing.</div>

    <div class="jewel"> <b> Commands Command Prompt Cannot Understand </b> </div>
    <div class="jewel">Like any normal person does, I spent the first day of December mostly on my computer. Recently, I had my almost
    five-year-old MacBook Pro break down on me, so I've been borrowing a Lenovo Thinkpad until my laptop arrives. I opened Command Prompt
    to set up a few repos on the new computer when, to my surprise, the 'ls' command refused to work. A quick Google search yields the answer:
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42727245/ls-in-cmd-on-windows-not-recognized">'ls' is not a recognized command
    in Command Prompt!</a> It's only a Unix command. You have to use the equivalent 'dir' while working in Command Prompt. As someone who's used Terminal for
    their entire programming career, this was a pretty neat new thing to learn.</div>
    <div class="jewel">Computer scientists and their love for inconsistencies, am I right?</div>
