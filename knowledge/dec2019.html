  <h1> Shards of Knowledge - December 2019 </h1>

  <p> It's the festive time of the year -- the final one, as we head into the 2020s. </p>

    <div class="jewel"> <b> Meter </b> </div>
    <div class="jewel"> If I asked you to define a meter, you'll probably tell me it's a 100 centimeters, or about 1.1 yards.
      Maybe you'll spread out your arms and show me an approximation, or compare it to your height. And that's all fine for a casual
      conversation on length. That's not fine, though, for scientists trying to find a rigorous definition for the meter; as the SI unit for length, the sciences necessitate a more formal definition.
      So, in 1983, the meter became accurately defined through a universal constant: <i>c</i>, the speed of light.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition">The meter is now the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second.</a>
      In an interesting way, perhaps running counterintuitive to our early education, the speed of light is not determined in terms of meters -- the meter is defined in terms of the speed of light.

    <div class="jewel"> <b> Stuck In The Sky </b> </div>
    <div class="jewel">Tomorrow morning, I'll be in an airplane, on my way back to the United States.
      My flight's going to be around 13 hours. That's a long, long time to be stuck on an airplane thousands of feet
      in the air, in a seat too cramped and too small. My intense flight got me curious about what the longest commercial passenger flight,
      time-wise, was. It turns out just a few months ago <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/10/20/get-ready-hour-flight-qantas-sets-record-ultralong-trip/"> a Qantas
      airplane flew from New York to Syndey for just over 19 hours.</a> That's a record for longest nonstop commercial passenger flight. It seems to mostly be a one-off experimental flight, though.
      The longest flight offered is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericrosen/2019/01/02/the-2019-list-of-the-longest-flights-in-the-world/#91213d3550b7">Singapore Airline's Singapore-Newark flight, which takes a whopping 18 hours and 30 minutes. </a>
     </div>
    <div class="jewel">Boy am I suddenly happy that I'm trapped on an airplane for only 13 hours. Well, time to catch up on reading <i>We Need to Talk About Kevin</i> and play some more Super Smash Bros. Melee!</div>

    <div class="jewel"> <b> Software Developer Fails at Making Simple Website </b> </div>
    <div class="jewel">When I decided to sit down and finally begin making a small website where I can host my idle thoughts,
      my immediate reaction was honestly probably fear. That's part of the reason I'm doing this, true, but still,
      man am I bad at web dev. Look, I literally learned just today you can
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors">make CSS classes within the CSS file</a>
      by doing .class_name. I... didn't know that was a thing.</div>
    <div class="jewel">I'm so amazing.</div>

    <div class="jewel"> <b> Commands Command Prompt Cannot Understand </b> </div>
    <div class="jewel">Like any normal person does, I spent the first day of December mostly on my computer. Recently, I had my almost
    five-year-old MacBook Pro break down on me, so I've been borrowing a Lenovo Thinkpad until my laptop arrives. I opened Command Prompt
    to set up a few repos on the new computer when, to my surprise, the 'ls' command refused to work. A quick Google search yields the answer:
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42727245/ls-in-cmd-on-windows-not-recognized">'ls' is not a recognized command
    in Command Prompt!</a> It's only a Unix command. You have to use the equivalent 'dir' while working in Command Prompt. As someone who's used Terminal for
    their entire programming career, this was a pretty neat new thing to learn.</div>
    <div class="jewel">Computer scientists and their love for inconsistencies, am I right?</div>
