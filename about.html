  <h1> About </h1>

  <p>Hi. I'm MarcerCyoon. Just one random guy in the vast world who wants to leave their own mark on history (however small).</p>

      Hello there. I hope you're having a good day or night so far. As I write this little introduction, I have no idea who will be reading or visiting.
      Will it be me from the future? Some friend of mine who enjoys to tease me a little too much? Or some stranger, decades later,
      stumbling across a relic of the Internet? Regardless, welcome.
    </div>
    <div class="jewel">
      I confess, one of my greatest weaknesses is my laziness. My inability to get started on the wonderful ideas
      that always formulate in my head. I hazard that this is probably due to a complacency on my part; I feel
      too okay with the status quo, too satisfied with my current self. Perhaps this is why once I do get started, once the status
      quo is broken, it's almost impossible to stop me. My fire has been ignited -- my creative drive burns with a new passion, and carries me until I once again reach complacency.
    </div>
    <div class="jewel">
      And so to force myself out of complacency, I decided to make this website. By forcing myself to update it, I hopefully
      force myself to stop enjoying complacency and rather actively try to combat it.  Even making this website will be such
      an attempt: I'm not a web developer, so doing something like this will hopefully make me encounter walls,
      realize my inadequacies, and light the fire I know that is hidden underneath.
    </div>
    <div class="jewel">
      You're probably getting tired of all the fire metaphors. Alright, I'll make this quick. All I want from this
      little project is to learn, to write, to <i> act</i> -- and in action, learn about myself. And perhaps those lessons I take away
      can help you, dear reader, too.

        Within the Writings page, you'll find some of my writings -- some rambly, some poetic, some fictional.

    <div class="jewel">
        Within the Shards of Knowledge page, you'll find my facts of the day -- a written record of me learning something new every single day.
    </div>
    <div class="jewel">
        Within the Entertainment Den page, you'll find a bunch of things related to my favorite entertainment -- movies, games, books.
    </div>
    <div class="jewel">
        I hope you enjoy your stay.
